### Project Title: 
Analyzing Flood Impact and Population Exposure in Pakistan Using Satellite and Population Data. 
### Domain: Environmental Data Analysis 
### Project Overview 
This project aims to analyze flood impacts and population exposure across Pakistan using     satellite- derived flood extent data and population data from August to October 2024. By examining the extent of flooded areas, cloud-free coverage, and estimated population at risk, this project seeks to provide actionable insights into flood exposure patterns, identify high-risk areas, and inform flood response strategies. 
### Objectives 
1.	Flood Extent Analysis: We will examine how floodwaters spread across different regions and time periods. We will create maps showing where floods occur and how they change over time. 
2.	Population Exposure Analysis: Calculate how many people are at risk when floods are at their lowest and highest levels. This will help us find the areas with the most people in danger. 
3.	Flooding Changes Over Time: Study how the amount of flooded land changes over different periods. This will show us where flooding gets worse or better and how that affects people living there. 
4.	Impact of Cloud-Free Coverage: Check how cloud cover affects our ability to see flooded areas. Cloudy areas can’t be analyzed, so we’ll study how this limits our data and affects the accuracy of our findings. 
5.	Risk Assessment by Region: Rank regions based on flood levels and how many people are exposed to floods. This will help identify high-risk areas so that emergency services can focus on the places most in need. 
### Project Impact: 
 This analysis will provide valuable insights into flood exposure and population risk in Pakistan, which can be used by government agencies, humanitarian organizations, and emergency responders for disaster planning and response. Identifying high-risk areas can help optimize resource allocation, improve preparedness strategies, and mitigate the impacts of future floods. 
### Data Source Acknowledgment

 ### Business Questions: 
 
1.	Which areas need urgent help because of high flood risk and many people being affected? 
2.	How can we best send emergency teams and supplies to reduce injuries and damage during floods? 
3.	What trends in flooding over time can help create better early warning systems and plans to prevent problems before they happen? 
4.	What new infrastructure projects (like flood barriers or drainage systems) would help the most to reduce flood damage and keep people safe? 
5.	What changes in city planning or building rules could help prevent serious flooding in the future? 
6.	Which current policies need to be updated or improved based on recent flood risk data to better protect communities?
